`gotcha` is a simple tool that grabs Go packages

## Description

Once you've found a Go software title to your liking, you can easily install it with `gotcha`: just add the package name.


***DEMO:***

## Features

- **config.toml**

	It is possible to manage the go package list that you want to install by writing a TOML file such as the following:

	```toml
	repos = [
		"github.com/BurntSushi/toml",
		"github.com/BurntSushi/toml/cmd/tomlv",
		"github.com/b4b4r07/gch",
		"github.com/b4b4r07/go-pipe",
		"github.com/b4b4r07/gomi",
		# ...,
	]
	```

	[TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) is easier to read and easier to write than [JSON](https://json.org).

- **Install in parallel**

	Fast installation thanks to the parallel processing by goroutine.

## Usage

[`repos`](https://github.com/b4b4r07/gotcha/blob/master/example/config.toml#L1) that are described in `config.toml` will be install or update.

```console
$ gotcha --help
Usage: gotcha [options] [path]
gotcha is a simple tool that grabs Go packages

Options:
--verbose, -v     Cause gotcha to be verbose, showing items as they are installed.

```

## Installation

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b4b4r07/screenshots/master/gotcha/installation.png)

If you want to go the Go way (install in GOPATH/bin) and just want the command:

```console
$ go get github.com/b4b4r07/gotcha
```

## Configuration

To customize gotcha settings:

```toml:
repos = [
	# Adding the repository to repos
    "github.com/BurntSushi/toml",
    "github.com/BurntSushi/toml/cmd/tomlv",
]
